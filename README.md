# react-mobx-minimal-setup

This is a minimal setup for applications, that would like to utilize react with a fast, reliable, and scalable solution for state management.

## Why not redux?

I've worked 3 years with redux as for now, and I prefer Mobx over redux for sake of simplicity.
Working with redux I appointed multiple problems coming from its architecture decisions, and there were no good solutions for them.

Mobx has a lower learning curve, there is less boilerplate and it doesn't require changing the architecture of your application.
